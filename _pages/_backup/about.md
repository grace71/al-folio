I am a `Ph.D candidate` at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/){:target="\_black"} working with [Phillipa Gill](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~phillipa/){:target="\_black"} in the [Calipr](https://calipr.cs.umass.edu/){:target="\_black"} research group. 

My research interests are in the domain of network security and privacy with a focus on empirical measurement and detection.
